# Partial Discharge Localization
This repository maintain codes and logs for "Partial Discharge Localization in Power Transformer Tanks Using Machine Learning Methods" paper. This paper presents a comparison between machine learning (ML) methods used for partial discharge (PD) localization in a power transformer tank. ML and deep learning (DL) methods are examined from simplest (linear regression) to much more complex ones like convolutional neural networks (CNN). Several case studies are considered with different attributes such as the sensor position, the frequency content of the PD signal, and the size of the transformer tank. The PD location is predicted in 3D by means of a single-sensor electric field measurement. Features of each method, such as input signal, core methodology, correlation coefficient of predicted location with real location, and root mean square error (RMSE) analysis are summarized and compared.
